Plan for discovery
- Detect logged-in status on sites like Blogger, Pinterest, WordPress.com, WordPress.org installs; prompt user to configure that as their preferred share location.


Use a URL redirector and template:
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_Template
  http://example.com/people/{firstName}-{lastName}/SSN

Send to WordPress 
URL pattern: http://www.YOURDOMAINHERE.com/wp-admin/press-this.php?u=${url}&t=${title}&s=${source}&v=2



Conclusions of this investigation:
- Integrating into the page markup is awful
- All the various edge-cases with AJAX are awful (Gizmodo)
- The Chrome extension's button itself could be the general share action
- The extra part is auto-configuring that action based on discovery recipes that watch your browsing behavior and auto-prompt you for configuring new sites to share to.
